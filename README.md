# Portals

This code is modified version of Tab portal implementation provided by [Oliver Gunter](http://oliverguenther.de/2018/04/angular5-tabbed-components-with-cdk-portals/). All credits go to original author.

## What's wrong with this?

* I tried to add "active tab" by default but I've encountered change detection error
* I've added grid and grid resize option after tab is changed (as described in [this](https://github.com/tiberiuzuld/angular-gridster2/issues/114) bug)
